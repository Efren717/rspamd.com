                        By using the commercial support, you directly sponsor and encourage Rspamd development as an Open Source project. By using Open Source, you not only get a good and extendable solution but also contribute to your own independence and sovereignty. For example, a commercial vendor can easily stop your access if they want but Rspamd code is open and free in any scenario.

                        There are also priority support and SLA options in the package, so commercial support can be treated as insurance in terms of the benefits. We also plan to offer Rspamd training and webinars in the future to bridge documentation gaps and demonstrate how to harness the full potential of Rspamd.
