We have released **Rspamd 1.8.1** today.

There are couple of the incompatibilities introduced, hence, please check the [migration notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/tutorials/migration.html#migration-to-rspamd-181). These incompatibilities could affect almost any Rspamd installation with custom configuration, so please read the upgrade notes carefully.

## The most important features and fixes

* Critical fixes in [DMARC module]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/dmarc.html)

    DMARC module could insert temporary failure symbol instead of strong rejection in certain cases. This has been fixed in 1.8.1.
    There are many other bugs fixed in this module since the whole check logic has been rewritten in accordance to RFC.

* [Fuzzy check]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/fuzzy_check.html)

    Due to bug introduced in 1.8.0, there algorithm used to deterministically skip words in large text parts was not deterministic. It means that the exact words pipelines produced by different Rspamd instances might be different. It could affect if your words_limit was reached (default: `words_decay = 200` words). Hence, for large text parts it was expected to have misses in fuzzy and in Bayes classification. Whilst bayes missing should not be significant, the fuzzy misses might be very severe and they might break fuzzy detection for large text parts.

    In 1.8.1, we have fixed this issue and, since we have already broken the compatibility with 1.7.9, we have decided to increase `words_decay` to 600. Please ensure that you don't override this parameter anywhere (e.g. in `local.d/options.inc`, `override.d/options.inc` or any other override or local file) or your compatibility with Rspamd fuzzy storage would be lost for messages with more than `words_decay` threshold words.

* Various language detection issues have been fixed
* Experimental clustering plugin
* Important fixes for the [dynamic ratelimits]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/ratelimit.html)
* Fix options insertion
* Plug memory leak in redis pool
* Add `check_violation` feature to DKIM/ARC signing to avoid signing messages when there is an existing invalid DKIM signature
* Add only unique elements to Clickhouse url arrays
* Allow `g+:` and `g-:` composite atoms to include symbols with positive score and negative score
* Allow dkim domains check in [surbl module]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/surbl.html)
* Allow maps with HTTP auth using standard URL syntax
* Allow to disable actions by users settings by setting them to `null`
* Extend whitelisting options:
    - Allow per element whitelist/blacklist only behaviour
    - Introduce three types of lists:
        + Blacklists (bl)
        + Whitelists (wl)
        + Bidirectional lists (both)
* Use heuristical verdict instead of the plain action in plugins to detect if a message is clearly `spam`, `junk`, `ham` or `uncertain` when there is not enough confidence despite of the action being set
* Various Web Interface improvements and fixes driven by [Alexander Moisseev](https://github.com/moisseev)
