Today we have released Rspamd 3.7.4; the first release in the new stable branch of Rspamd 3.7.

The following changes are new in 3.7.4:

## Fixes:

* Fixed `setproctitle` on CentOS-likes
* Fixes for hyperscan cache file handling
* Fixed `exclude_local` in RBL module
* Properly set config field when loading tasks from Lua
* Set loaded variable explicitly

## Features:

* Enable fasttext on RPM based Linux
* Improve `FREEMAIL_AFF` capture rates
* Add rule for messages missing both X-Mailer and User-Agent header
* Add composite rule for suspicious URLs in suspicious messages

## Upgrading notes

The `exclude_private_ips` setting in RBL module no longer exists in this release (and was broken in previous releases), it can be removed from configuration. This setting is equivalent to `exclude_local`.
