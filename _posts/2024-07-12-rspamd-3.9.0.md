Today we have released Rspamd 3.9.0 featuring many new features & fixes, the most important of which are highlighted below. Refer to the [migration notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/tutorials/migration.html) for an overview of potentially-breaking changes only.

## Improvements to Bayes configuration

Rspamd now uses a reduced window size of 2 words by default; this change does not require statistics to be retrained. In testing this reduced window size has produced the same or better results with better performance & lower storage requirements. The new `rspamadm classifier_test` utility could be used for your own experiments.

## New GPT module

This release provides a module Rspamd for using LLMs for text classification, you could read more about it in a [dedicated blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}/misc/2024/07/03/gpt.html).

## Improvements to `known_senders` & `replies` modules

These release includes enhancements to the `known_senders` and `replies` modules enabling them to collectively flag verified user contacts, refer to documentation of these modules for more detail.

## Dynamic multipliers for ratelimits are now disabled by default

To prevent likely confusion, dynamic ratelimits are now disabled by default and must be configured explicitly, refer to the migration notes for details how.

## Various bugfixes & new features

* Reworked `grow_factor` to work in an orderly fashion
* Fixed `SUBJ_ALL_CAPS` for unicase scripts by `@ikedas`
* Fixed relearning of bayes messages by `@aduernberger`
* Fixed retrieving word count in antivirus module by `@PxPert`
* Improvements for rules by `@twesterhever` and `@ishisora`

Thank you to everyone who contributed.
