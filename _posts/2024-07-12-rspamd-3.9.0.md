Today we have released Rspamd 3.9.0, featuring many new features and fixes. The most important ones are highlighted below. Refer to the [migration notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/tutorials/migration.html) for an overview of potentially-breaking changes.

## Improvements to Bayes configuration

Rspamd now uses a reduced window size of 2 words by default. This change does not require retraining of statistics. In our tests, this reduced window size has produced the equal or better results with better performance and lower storage requirements. The new `rspamadm classifier_test` utility can be used for your own experiments.

## New GPT module

This release provides a module for using LLMs for text classification. You can read more about it in a [dedicated blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}/misc/2024/07/03/gpt.html).

## Improvements to `known_senders` and `replies` modules

This release includes enhancements to the `known_senders` and `replies` modules, enabling them to collectively flag verified user contacts. Refer to the documentation of these modules for more details.

## Dynamic multipliers for ratelimits are now disabled by default

To avoid potential confusion, dynamic ratelimits are now disabled by default and must be configured explicitly. Refer to the migration notes for details on how to do this.

## Various bug fixes and new features

* Reworked `grow_factor` to work in an orderly fashion
* Fixed `SUBJ_ALL_CAPS` for unicase scripts by `@ikedas`
* Fixed relearning of Bayes messages by `@aduernberger`
* Fixed retrieving word count in the antivirus module by `@PxPert`
* Improvements for rules by `@twesterhever` and `@ishisora`

We extend our gratitude to everyone who contributed to this release.
