Today we have released Rspamd 3.8.3, which is being maintained in the stable `rspamd-3.8` branch.

This release includes a fix for a regression in `redis_history` which caused history to be recorded to a misnamed key. No other changes were introduced in this release. See [the previous announcement]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/announce/2024/02/20/rspamd-3.8.2.html) for details of changes introduced in 3.8.2.
