Today we have released Rspamd 3.8.4, the second release cut from the recently-branched `rspamd-3.8` branch.

This release includes a fix for a regression in DMARC reporting which caused reports not to be sent. No other changes were introduced in this release. See [the previous announcement]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/announce/2024/02/22/rspamd-3.8.3.html) for details of changes introduced in 3.8.3.
