## Preface

Historically, our only text classification method has been Bayes, a powerful statistical method that performs well with sufficient training. However, Bayes has its limitations:

* It requires thorough and well-balanced training
* It cannot work with low confidence levels, especially when dealing with a wide variety of spam

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions to these challenges. These models can perform deep introspection with some sort of contextual "understanding". However, their high computational demands (typically requiring GPUs) make scanning all emails impractical. Separating LLM execution from the scanning engine mitigates resource competition.

## Rspamd GPT plugin

In Rspamd 3.9, I have tried to integrate the OpenAI GPT API for spam filtering and assess its usefulness. Here are some basic ideas behind this plugin:

* The selected displayed text part is extracted and submitted to the GPT API for spam probability assessment
* Additional message details such as Subject, Display From, and URLs are also included in the assessment
* Then we ask GPT to provide results in JSON format since human-readable GPT output cannot be parsed (in general)
* Some specific symbols (`BAYES_SPAM`, `FUZZY_DENIED`, `REPLY`, etc.) are excluded from the GPT scan
* Obvious spam and ham are also excluded from the GPT evaluation

The former two points reduce the GPT workload for something that is already known, where GPT cannot add any value in the evaluation. We also use GPT as one of the classifiers, meaning that we do not rely solely on GPT evaluation.
