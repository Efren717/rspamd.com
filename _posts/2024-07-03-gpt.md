## Preface

Historically, our only text classification method has been Bayes, a powerful statistical method that performs well with sufficient training. However, Bayes has its limitations:

* It requires thorough and well-balanced training
* It cannot work with low confidence levels, especially when dealing with a wide variety of spam

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions to these challenges. These models can perform deep introspection with some sort of contextual "understanding". However, their high computational demands (typically requiring GPUs) make scanning all emails impractical. Separating LLM execution from the scanning engine mitigates resource competition.

## Rspamd GPT plugin

In Rspamd 3.9, I have tried to integrate the OpenAI GPT API for spam filtering and assess its usefulness. Here are some basic ideas behind this plugin:

* The selected displayed text part is extracted and submitted to the GPT API for spam probability assessment
* Additional message details such as Subject, Display From, and URLs are also included in the assessment
* Then we ask GPT to provide results in JSON format since human-readable GPT output cannot be parsed (in general)
* Some specific symbols (`BAYES_SPAM`, `FUZZY_DENIED`, `REPLY`, etc.) are excluded from the GPT scan
* Obvious spam and ham are also excluded from the GPT evaluation

The former two points reduce the GPT workload for something that is already known, where GPT cannot add any value in the evaluation. We also use GPT as one of the classifiers, meaning that we do not rely solely on GPT evaluation.

## Evaluation results

To evaluate the performance of the GPT-based classifier, we developed the `rspamadm classifier_test` utility, capable of evaluating both supervised and unsupervised classifiers:

* It divides spam and ham samples into separate training and validation sets
* For supervised classifiers, it uses the training set to train the classifier
* Then both supervised and unsupervised classifiers are evaluated using the validation set to measure their performance

For example, the Bayes engine, trained on a robust corpus, demonstrates the following results:

~~~
$ rspamadm classifier_test --ham /ham --spam /spam --cv-fraction 0.3

Spam: 348 train files, 815 cv files; ham: 754 train files, 1762 cv files
Start learn spam, 348 messages, 10 connections
Start learn ham, 754 messages, 10 connections
Learning done: 348 spam messages in 1.61 seconds, 754 ham messages in 3.88 seconds
Start cross validation, 2577 messages, 10 connections
Metric               Value
------------------------------
True Positives       735
False Positives      22
True Negatives       1717
False Negatives      49
Accuracy             0.97
Precision            0.97
Recall               0.94
F1 Score             0.95
Classified (%)       97.90
Elapsed time (seconds) 12.71
~~~

These results are impressive but assume the classifier is properly and decently trained. In scenarios involving a fresh system or high variability in emails, gathering reliable statistics might be challenging.

In contrast, the GPT engine operates as an unsupervised learning algorithm. We assume that LLM models have enough "understanding" of the language to distinguish spam and ham without direct training on emails. Moreover, we provide only text data, not raw email content.

Below are the results from different GPT models:

### OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo

~~~
Metric               Value
------------------------------
True Positives       129
False Positives      35
True Negatives       263
False Negatives      69
Accuracy             0.79
Precision            0.79
Recall               0.65
F1 Score             0.71
Classified (%)       95.20
Elapsed time (seconds) 318.91
~~~

This model is cost-effective and can be used as a baseline. The results were obtained from a low-quality sample corpus, resulting in high false positives and negatives.

### OpenAI GPT-4o

~~~
Metric               Value
------------------------------
True Positives       178
False Positives      25
True Negatives       257
False Negatives      9
Accuracy             0.93
Precision            0.88
Recall               0.95
F1 Score             0.91
Classified (%)       90.02
Elapsed time (seconds) 279.08
~~~

Despite its high cost, this advanced model is suitable, for example, for low-traffic personal email. It demonstrates significantly lower error rates compared to GPT-3.5, even with a similar low-quality sample corpus.
