We have released **Rspamd 1.8.0** today.

There are couple of the incompatibilities introduced, hence, please check the [migration notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/tutorials/migration.html), especially if you use [clickhouse module]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/clickhouse.html) or [users settings]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/configuration/settings.html).

## The most important features and fixes

* New [**selectors framework**]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/configuration/selectors.html)

    This framework allows to combine and process different data extracted from messages and use that in different plugins, such as [multimap]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/multimap.html), [reputation]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/reputation.html) or [ratelimits]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/ratelimit.html). It is also possible to use data extracted in Rspamd [regular expressions]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/regexp.html).

* [**Coroutines** API]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/developers/sync_async.html) support in Lua

    Now you can write code in a usual imperative manner but you still will not block any other tasks. Each potentially blocking operation creates a yielding-point. In turn, this means the code is suspended until the operation is done (just like blocking) and resumes only when there is some result. Meanwhile, other tasks are processed as usual.

* [Clickhouse]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/clickhouse.html) optimization

    Rspamd now uses a flat table to optimize ClickHouse SQL requests. In fact, joins are not recommended by the ClickHouse developers as multiple joins have proven to be slow. Hence, Rspamd has moved all data to a single table. Schema migration is done automatically, however, please read the [migration notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/tutorials/migration.html) in case of any doubts. Old data is not migrated nor deleted automatically.

    There is now optional data retention support in the ClickHouse module. You can set retention policies for the data stored in Clickhouse to conform different regulations (e.g. GDPR).

* Unicode processing improvements

    Rspamd now normalizes all unicode data using NFKC schema prior to processing. This helps to prevent "glyph" attacks used by some spammers nowadays. Unicode conversion has also been improved to continue on bad symbols instead of giving up and working with raw data.

* Language detection improvements

    We have reworked the language detector to use stop-words and rely on unicode glyphs more extensively. As the result of this work, the speed of language detection has been increased significantly (by 10 times in some cases). The preciseness of the detection has also been improved.

* Fixed various bugs in sesssions handling

    We have located and fixed various hidden issues caused by async rules chaining. It might cause inconsistencies in the dependencies processing, crashes in rare cases and other "bad things".

* Various [Web Interface]({{ site.baseurl }}/webui/) improvements and fixes

    There are multiple improvements and fixes in the Web Interface. In particular, the issues with cluster support and aggregation have been addressed. 

* New [mailing lists](https://lists.rspamd.com) for the project
    - [Rspamd-Users](https://lists.rspamd.com/mailman/listinfo/users): general purpose mailing list that will replace this group
    - [Rspamd-Announce](https://lists.rspamd.com/mailman/listinfo/announce): read only list with low traffic that is intended for project announcements only, for example, new versions, or vulnerabilities disclosures

    Unfortunately, there is no automatic conversion from the Google groups to the new mailing lists, hence, you need to subscribe to those lists manually. We are sorry about the potential inconveniences caused by this transition.

    To subscribe to a list, click the list name at https://lists.rspamd.com/mailman/listinfo . The page that is displayed should contain all of the necessary subscription instructions for that list. You can always find all possible support channels [here](https://rspamd.com/support.html).
