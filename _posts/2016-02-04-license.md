In the modern world, software patents are a significant threat for the Open Source software. Therefore, I have decided to switch from the original [BSD license](https://opensource.org/license/BSD-2-Clause) to [Apache-2 license](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0).
Whilst Apache license has the same permissive clauses as BSD license has there is an explicit definition of software patents in Apache license. The Apache License contains both a patent grant and a patent retaliation clause.

Another terms of licensing have not been changed: you can still use the code in your projects and you are **not** obliged to open your modifications to the code like you need in GPL. Contributed code is still licensed under BSD license.
