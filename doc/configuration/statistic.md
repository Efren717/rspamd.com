# Rspamd statistic settings

## Introduction

Rspamd utilizes statistics to determine the classification of messages into either spam or ham categories. This classification process is based on the Bayesian theorem, which combines probabilities to assess the likelihood of a message belonging to a particular class, such as `spam` or `ham`. The following factors play a role in determining this probability:

- the probability of a specific token to be spam or ham (which means efficiently count of a token's occurrences in spam and ham messages)
- the probability of a specific token to appear in a message (which efficiently means frequency of a token divided by a number of tokens in a message)

## Statistics Architecture

However, Rspamd employs more advanced techniques to combine probabilities, including sparsed bigrams (OSB) and the inverse chi-square distribution.

The `OSB` algorithm goes beyond considering single words as tokens and instead takes into account combinations of words, taking into consideration their positions. This schema is visually represented in the following diagram:

The main drawback of this approach is the increased number of tokens, which is multiplied by the size of the window. In Rspamd, we use a window size of 5 tokens, resulting in the number of tokens being approximately **5 times larger** than the number of words.

Statistical tokens are stored in statfiles, which are then mapped to specific backends. This architecture is visually represented in the following diagram:

## Statistics Configuration

Starting from Rspamd 2.0, we recommend using `redis` as the backend and `osb` as the tokenizer, which are set as the default settings. The default configuration settings can be found in the `$CONFDIR/statistic.conf` file.

~~~hcl
classifier "bayes" {
  tokenizer {
    name = "osb";
  }
  cache {
  }
  new_schema = true; # Always use new schema
  store_tokens = false; # Redefine if storing of tokens is desired
  signatures = false; # Store learn signatures
  #per_user = true; # Enable per user classifier
  min_tokens = 11;
  backend = "redis";
  min_learns = 200;

  statfile {
    symbol = "BAYES_HAM";
    spam = false;
  }
  statfile {
    symbol = "BAYES_SPAM";
    spam = true;
  }
  learn_condition = 'return require("lua_bayes_learn").can_learn';

  # Autolearn sample
  # autolearn {
  #  spam_threshold = 6.0; # When to learn spam (score >= threshold)
  #  ham_threshold = -0.5; # When to learn ham (score <= threshold)
  #  check_balance = true; # Check spam and ham balance
  #  min_balance = 0.9; # Keep diff for spam/ham learns for at least this value
  #}

  .include(try=true; priority=1) "$LOCAL_CONFDIR/local.d/classifier-bayes.conf"
  .include(try=true; priority=10) "$LOCAL_CONFDIR/override.d/classifier-bayes.conf"
}

.include(try=true; priority=1) "$LOCAL_CONFDIR/local.d/statistic.conf"
.include(try=true; priority=10) "$LOCAL_CONFDIR/override.d/statistic.conf"
~~~

To enable per-user statistics, you can add the `users_enabled = true` property to the configuration of the classifier. However, it is important to ensure that Rspamd is called at the final delivery stage (e.g., LDA mode) to avoid issues with multi-recipient messages. When dealing with multi-recipient messages, Rspamd will use the first recipient for user-based statistics. 
It's worth noting that Rspamd prioritizes SMTP recipients over MIME ones and gives preference to the special LDA header called `Delivered-To`, which can be appended using the `-d` option for `rspamc`. This allows for more accurate per-user statistics in your configuration.

### Classifier and headers

The classifier in Rspamd learns headers that are specifically defined in the `classify_headers` section of the `options.inc `file. Therefore, there is no need to remove any additional headers (e.g., X-Spam) before the learning process, as these headers will not be utilized for classification purposes. Rspamd also takes into account the `Subject` header, which is tokenized according to the aforementioned rules. Additionally, Rspamd considers various meta-tokens, such as message size or the number of attachments, which are extracted from the messages for further analysis.

## Redis statistics

Supported parameters for the Redis backend are:

- `tokenizer`: leave it as shown for now. Currently, only OSB is supported
- `backend`: set it to Redis
- `servers`: IP or hostname with a port for the Redis server. Use an IP for the loopback interface, if you have defined localhost in /etc/hosts for IPv4 and IPv6, or your Redis server will not be found!
- `write_servers` (optional): If needed, define dedicated servers for learning
- `password` (optional): Password for the Redis server
- `db` (optional): Database to use (though it is recommended to use dedicated Redis instances and not databases in Redis)
- `min_tokens`: minimum number of words required for statistics processing
- `min_learns` (optional): minimum learn to count for **both** spam and ham classes to perform  classification
- `auto-learn` (optional): see below for details
- `per_user` (optional): enable perusers statistics. See above
- `statfile`: Define keys for spam and ham mails.
- `learn_condition` (optional): Lua function for autolearning as described below.
 
You are also recommended to use [`bayes_expiry` module](https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/bayes_expiry.html) to maintain your statistics database.

## Autolearning

Starting from version 1.1, Rspamd introduces autolearning functionality for statfiles. Autolearning occurs after all rules, including statistics, have been processed. However, it only applies if the same symbol has not already been added. For example, if `BAYES_SPAM` is already present in the checking results, the message will not be learned as spam.

There are three options available for specifying autolearning:

* `autolearn = true`: autolearning is performing as spam if a message has `reject` action and as ham if a message has **negative** score
* `autolearn = [-5, 5]`: autolearn as ham if the score is less than `-5` and as spam if the score is more than `5`
* `autolearn = "return function(task) ... end"`: use the following Lua function to detect if autolearn is needed (function should return 'ham' if learn as ham is needed and string 'spam' if learn as spam is needed, if no learning is needed then a function can return anything including `nil`)

Redis backend is highly recommended for autolearning purposes due to its ability to handle high concurrency levels when multiple writers are synchronized properly. Using Redis as the backend ensures efficient and reliable autolearning functionality.
